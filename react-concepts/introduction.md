# What is React ?
---
- React is a JavaScript library for building and rendering user interfaces (UIs).

- UI is built from small units like buttons, images, forms, text, and more.

- React lets us combine these units into reusable components, making the code modular and easy to maintain.

- Everything on the screen can be broken down into components â€” from a single button to an entire page.
  

- Components can be nested inside other components to form complex UIs.

- React uses a declarative approach: instead of manually updating the DOM, you just tell React what the UI should look like, and it handles the updates.

- React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that change, improving performance.

- Data flows in one direction (unidirectional data flow), which makes apps predictable and easier to debug.

  

- React works with JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

- React is the foundation for React Native, which allows building mobile apps using the same component-based approach.

- The ecosystem is huge: React can be combined with tools like Redux, React Router, and Next.js to build full-fledged web apps.
